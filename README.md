# Projeto Info Periféricos

O projeto tem como objetivo criar cards de periféricos e cadastrá-los em listas, as listas podem ser criadas contendo um valor estimado para elas, tanto os cards e
as listas podem ser deletadas ou modificadas.

## Objetivo do projeto
- atualmente estou me desenvolvendo em front-end com JS, React e Sass.

O objetivo do projeto foi a utilização do React.js para criar uma interface ágil que funcione de forma rápida e satisfatoria ao carregar seus contéudos, utiilizando o
react-router foi póssivel criar uma interface que navegue entre a criação e a visualizazção dos cards e listas de forma fluida sem a necessidade de recarregamento da página, a estilização e manutenção estão mais simples com a modularização do css utilizando o sass.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
